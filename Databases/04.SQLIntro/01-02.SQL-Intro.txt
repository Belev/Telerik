	- What is SQL ?
		* SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language.
		* SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute),
		* it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks
		* such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are:
		* Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional
		* proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as
		* "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.
